# 🛵 Helmet Violation Detection using YOLOv8 + OpenCV

This project detects **bike riders not wearing helmets** in real-time using computer vision and AI.  
It captures violations and saves snapshots for evidence using a webcam feed.

## 🔍 Features

-  Real-time detection via webcam
-  Detects riders with and without helmets
-  Saves snapshots of violations (no helmet)
-  YOLOv8 model trained on helmet dataset
-  Built with Python, OpenCV, and Ultralytics
